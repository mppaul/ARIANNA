This folder contains the files and data from BMU Noise tests. According to 
the Antarctica team the wind gen does not supply constant charging and 
discharging to the BMU. The idea is that the BMU has to make more desicions 
when it loses charging voltage and when it gains it. Causing more noise to 
be created. 

Test #1
______________________

This test will look at the baseline noise while the station is charging and 
discharging. Force triggers and thermal triggers are taken to measure the 
noise level (Force Triggers) and the fluctuations in the noise that can 
trigger the station. In addition, we will look at the noise generated when
the power supply that is charging the station is cut off and turned on 
multiple times and when it is, decently, slowly ramped up and declined.
