			   SBD File Transfer Study

Problem

This folder contains all the files related to the tests done to figure out the
reason so many data files are lost during data transfer with Iridium (SBD) or 
transfering the wrong data.

==============================================================================
Test #1 - Preliminary Data Transfer Test
--------

Each run file will contain only one sequence. This data will be taken in 
advance of the data transfer test. During the test the station will be asked
to send this data that is on the SD card. All data transfered in this test will
have the same communication settings.   

Data on SD:
r00701 -- 10 FTpS
r00702 -- 50 FTpS
r00703 -- 100 FTpS
r00704 -- 150 FTpS
r00705 -- 200 FTpS
r00706 -- 300 FTpS

FTpS = Force Triggers per Sequence

Communication Settings:
